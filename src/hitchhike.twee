You stand on the side of the road, waiting for a car to emerge from the darkness. 

You finally see a pair of headlights in the distance.

You put your thumb up and the car speeds past you with no intention of stopping.
 
 So far it seems like no one wants to help you...

:: thumb up
You notice that the truck approaching you seems to be slowing down. You let out a sigh of relief.

When the truck gets closer, you begin to back up from the road. The truck stops and a man rolls down his window.

"Where you headed?" the man demanded.

You have the address of the corner store closest to your house on your phone, and you show it to him. The man's face lights up.

"I have to pass through that area. hop in!" the man chimed.

He was kind of creepy. The wild look in his eyes makes you hesitate to hop in, but you really have no other choice and you're exhausted.

You [[hop in]].
