You enter the vehicle and are immediately begin to feel as if something isn't right. 

"Make yourself comfortable." the man proposed. 

There's no way you're going to 'get comfortable' and let your guard down in this creepy man's car. You try to not make it so obvious that you're on edge, but your body language catches the man's attenton.

"Don't be so tense. Try and relax." the man proposes.

You let out a nervous chuckle and try to relax. Maybe this guy is actually just a nice guy and not [[some serial killer]].

As you and the man exchange small talk, the rain begins to fall once more. 

You begin to get a little too comfortable, as your eyes begin to get droopy.

After fighting a long battle with your eyes, you eventually lose and [[fall asleep]].

You're suddently jolted awake when the truck hits a bump. The rain has stopped.

Your surroundings look...very off from what they should look like. Either this man is taking a shortcut, got lost, or is intentionally going in the wrong direction.

You pull out your phone to text your friends about what's going on. You're beating yourself up because you didn't think to tell anyone that you were hitchiking in the first palce. 

Your phone is now at 1% as you frantically text your family and friends.

"What are you doing?" the man questioned.

"I'm just going on Twitter so I don't fall asleep again." Even you can hear the shakiness in your voice.

The man can see right through your lie and snatches your phone out of your hands.

You begin to feel helpless, as you thought your phone was your only possible way of escaping this situation alive. YOu begin to feel [[nauseous]].

As you feel vomit coming up your throat, you quickly try and come up with a plan to escape the man. 

The truck is going too fast for you to simply tuck and roll. You decide to do what came to your mind first and turn towards the man. He sees that you're about to vomit and begins to scoot away from you while slowing down the truck.

You vomit and make sure to do so all over the man's lap. 

The man slows the truck down and you only have a few seconds to make a move.
